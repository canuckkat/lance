# Lance

## Summary
Help support Lance's lavish lifestyle. But in all seriousness, he's a senior boi and his meds and vet visits are pretty expensive. (Especially when I'm unemployed.)

## How Can You Help?
Honestly, his hay and meds cost are the biggest expense. Below are links to supplies and the retailers I usually get them from.

### Supplies
- XL dog pee pads
- paper litter
- pine pellets

### Hay
- Hay Stacks
- 90 oz Timothy and Orchard Grass hay blend

### Medical Expenses
If you would donate to Lance's medical expenses fund, feel free to e-Transfer me with comments in the transfer so I know what it's for :)

# More Info
## Daily Needs
### Supplies
We use XL dog pee pads with paper litter or pine pellets in his bed because he loves lying in there, and the litter (with a hay top layer) helps avoid urine scald from lying in the pee spots.

### Hay
Hay in big quantities don't currently work in our routines. The hay currently in rotation are:
- Oxbow Hay Stacks
- Hay Blends â€“ Western Timothy & Orchard

### Greens
Lance loves most greens! But mom doesn't have capacity to wash and prep on a regular basis, so we get pre-washed packaged greens instead.

Packaged greens selection:
- field/spring greens
- arugula
- romaine
- kale (baby and mature)
- bok choy

He also loves herbs!
- parsley
- dill
- lemongrass

## Medication
Lance's daily meds for his arthritis and eye allergies cost about $300 every few months.

## Vet Visits
His regular annual checkup with vaccines is about $300-400. And additional routine tests to check kidney function that he needs annually are ~$300.

What vaccine you may ask? There's a hemorrhagic virus pandemic happening in North America. So fun :(
